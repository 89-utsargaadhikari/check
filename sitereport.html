        <p>I believe it makes me easier to build a good-looking website by completing the HTML first and styling the website. So I have planned to finish the whole HTMl part for my module and style the module.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>19th May: I started building my module and created index.html and contact.html page.</li>
            <li>19th May: I completed the HTML for my index.html and contact.html page which I have uploaded to github.</li>
            <li>20th May: I started to build sitereport.html page for my module.</li>
            <li>22nd May: I completed the HTML part for my portfoilio.html page.</li>
            <li>23rd May: I completed the HTML part for my cv.html. Hence, I finished the HTML part for my module.</li>

    <h1 class="ray">A Reflective Discussion Of My Module</h1>
    <div class="discuss">
       
        <p>I had a great time doing my assingment as it gave me a chance to put together the knowledge and tricks of HTML and CSS that I have learned throughout the term.</p>
        <p class="black">1. Layout and Website design used in my website</p>
        <p>The layout and the design ideas were of my own, Visual Studio Code made it easy for me to pick the colors best for my website.
            I used Teal as the background color of my menu bar, rgb(143, 194, 196) for my background color.
        </p>
        <p>The idea of using dot and small bracket {eg, .home()} was taken from website design ideas found in the Internet. </p>
        <P>CSS grid was used for placing the placeholder images in my portfoilio.html page.</P>
        <p>I used tables to build my CV and I have used my column skills to build my Curriculum Vitae. </p>

        <p class="black">2. Transitions used in my module</p>
        <p>I have used simple and basic tranisitions in my website. I feel one's porfolio site should be kept basic and simple than fancy, so I have not overdone the transitions for my module
            and kept it simple. Although I believe I've used the transition property very well to give the best results to my module. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="black">3. Animations</p>
        <p>I have used simple animations for my website which I learned from  scrimba.com from going opacity and width 0% to 100%</p>

    <h1 class="exp">My experience in learning the basics of web-development.</h1>


    <div class="port">

        <p>I wanted to learn coding since I was studying in Grade-8, but I have to confess I never tried to learn. It's hardly been two months since I started learning basics of html and css.
            I had a great time learning html and css. The basic html was really easy. I learned the starting basics from my college and my curiosity started to increase to I started to learn from scrimba.
        </p>
        <p>Was it hard? My experience in the beginning was quite exciting until I got to css padding and flexbox which gave me a headache before I grasped the concept, thanks to scrimba.com which helped me to understand the concept</p>
        
        <p>But I had a great time learning css animations, which I found really interesting and exciting. And there is always so much to learn in CSS.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and css are easy to learn.</li>
            <li>HTML is supported by all the browsers.</li>
            <li>HTML is simple to edit.</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS are lightweight.</li>
            <li>HTMl and CSS are the base to any web applications a developer needs to master.</li>
        </ul>       

        <p>As conclusion, it's okay if you are trying to learn through tutorial videos and websites, but in my point of view you can only master HTML and CSS if you dedicate enough time to have troubles and solve them. You can never know much there is always so much to learn.
         And if you need some sites to learn HTML and CSS for free, you can visit</p>
        <ul>
         <li>freecodecamp.org</li>
        <li>scrimba.com</li>
